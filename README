With LeOS-AppVault you can set a Pin/Pattern/Fingerprint lock for every app. You can hide contacts, Notes, pictures or videos.
You should always leave the app with 'back' button.
Contacts= If you create a contect direct in the app, it's has only limited fields and you can edit them
Videos= Once in Vault, ever in Vault. No way to delete
You should lock 'Settings' in the app to prevend uninstalling the app.    
If you are using ClassyShark, you will find 12 Trackers (most are adds 'tracker'). I haven't removed them all because I have restricted the Internet access. So the trackers can't download any add or upload any collected data. I will work on removing the trackers. Stay tuned
